# Identification-of-Flux-Ropes-in-Space-Plasma-Time-Series
We implemented a method to identify flux ropes based on correlations between variables (from in situ observation data). This method was proposed in the paper "A new method to identify flux ropes in space plasmas" available at the following link: https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-36-1275-2018

For some reason, the output for our attempt to reproduce the 'Model Test' section is not consistent with the output observed in the paper (https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-36-1275-2018). Therefore, we will test the code's consistency using the observed series data that were also discussed in the paper (Subsections 4.1 and 4.2).
