# Identification-of-Flux-Ropes-in-Space-Plasma-Time-Series
We implemented a method to identify flux ropes based on correlations between variables (from in situ observation data). This method was proposed in the paper "A new method to identify flux ropes in space plasmas" available at the following link: https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-36-1275-2018
